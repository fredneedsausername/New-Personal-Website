# My Fascination With Programming

## Presentation

I am Federico Veronesi. At the time of writing, I am 18 years old. I used to be a high school student, and now I'm about to enroll in the University of Pisa for computer engineering. It is a separate field from computer science, at least in Italy. The first one is engineering with elements of the second, which is more "pure". As you can see from my portfolio website, [fredver.it](https://fredver.it), I have programmed anything from embedded systems to web solutions, manually deploying my work each time and managing the servers.

## First Contact

I technically started coding at the age of 6, when my father (a fellow computer engineer) made me write my first while loop in C# to solve a made-up problem whose specifics are lost to time. At double that age, I started playing with code again, using the Mimo code learning platform to learn HTML. At the time I was just a kid, so I quickly stopped being interested in what is possibly the most boring programming language, to return to my concerns about being the coolest boy in school or whatever else an adolescent kid concerns themselves with.

## Real Start

It all started for real with a simple Python programming course in high school. It was nothing special, but that's where I first started wondering about the hidden potential of coding. We were just taught the basics: what an integer is, how to print "Hello, World!" and so on. I just couldn't stop my mind from wandering. "What if I printed a maze, and took the user input to make them navigate it" I thought. When we were taught lists, I immediately wondered whether it was possible to have lists of lists. And don't get me started on recursion. It all just seemed obvious and interconnected. I felt like flying freely on top of the world, the clouds being ideas just flowing and passing by. It felt good, it felt right.

## Lethargic Sleep

After this course, I got into a lethargic computer science sleep. I forgot how amazing it felt, what it was like to have creativity coursing through my veins. I preferred videogames instead, going out with friends, playing sports, and anything else that wasn't studying computer science or implementing my own creative solutions.

## The Awakening

Fortunately, at the start of my third year of high school I rediscovered my long-lost passion. I attended a high school that had computer science classes. I have some reservations about the didactics, but I'll go into the details in a future article. For now, I'll just say that we had textbooks on computer science. These books were **great**. They taught me the basics of computer science, starting from the difference between the Harvard and the Von Neumann architectures to the difference between the OOP, procedural, logic, and functional paradigms of programming languages. The books in question are the "Informatica app" series by Piero Gallo and Pasquale Sirsi. Without them, I wouldn't know the difference between top-down and bottom-up approaches, nor would I ever have started with C, which has greatly influenced my mindset and attitude towards computer science.

## The Studies

I started to fall in love with the field. I memorized every single thing on most pages of these books very easily. For the most part, I preferred to read the smallest amount of any given topic, and reinvent it from scratch using that information. That gave me a unique, profound, and very personal deep understanding of every topic. Not every hour of every day in school was put to good use: Many times there were oral tests only for a part of the classroom, so we were just left there to entertain ourselves. Many scrolled through their phones; others chatted with their classmates. But I was locked in: I **had to** consume knowledge.

## My First Crush

C was my programming language of choice to play with algorithms and data structures. I fell in love with the feeling of rediscovering existing ones on my own, and reimplementing them from scratch. I had a lot of fun on LeetCode and CodeWars, often implementing linked lists or graphs or binary trees and whatever algorithm alongside them, using C to optimize the solutions and squeeze every last drop of efficiency I could from my code. I did not choose the easy path. I did not choose to look up how to implement a binary tree, and copy-paste the code. I distinctly remember having written dozens of pages of notes on my own algorithms to optimize binary trees' lookups and insertions. I was rediscovering everything from scratch. My friends thought I was crazy. Also, my sleep schedule was desperately crying for help. Three to five hours of sleep were not sufficient, but I made it work: I needed as much free time as possible to dedicate to my passion. I distinctly remember the feeling of losing my balance on my own when standing up, because of sleep deprivation. I have never been shy, not at all, in fact, but I was socializing less and less. I became more and more selective of who I was spending my time with. I have no regrets of what I decided to make of my life at that time. I felt like I needed to fully invest myself into this, and I'm sure I made the right call.

## My Next Love

My father has worked in corporate for his whole life. There they use Java. So, naturally, when I felt like I had learned enough about C, I asked him to point me to another language to learn, and that was his suggestion. I simply fell in love with it. OOP is such a powerful paradigm, with infinite design patterns: Observer, Strategy, Factory, Singleton, and so on. That's where I learned not to exaggerate with planning beforehand. But also, the functional patterns introduced in Java 8 mesmerized me. SAM interfaces and CompletableFutures monopolized my attention for the longest time. I particularly loved in-depth books like "On Java 8" by Bruce Eckel, which I still consider my favourite book.

## Modern Times

The "modern times" started when I got a fantastic idea: "What if I made my house a small weather station?" So I bought some Arduinos, rented a VPS, and started honing in on the direction of web development. To this day, I consider it my strongest field. So I made my website, where you're probably reading this from. Yes, I originally made it just to showcase the data from the devices. It only became a portfolio later (and now a blog, too). I learned the whole standard tech stack, how to deploy on linux, databases, and so on. But where did this idea come from? It was a mix of mild external inspiration and of my signature unhinged creative thinking. A city next to mine was collecting environmental pollution data from their local lake, and so I told myself that I could also collect data about my surroundings. After analyzing the problem carefully, I assessed that I would **only** have to learn embedded systems programming, web development, server management, databases... So I did!

## Freelance Work

My father, being well connected in the world of freelance work, acted as a bridge between me and a shipyard company. Specifically, I started with the ACCA project. You can find all the information in the dedicated project page in this website or on my GitHub, which is linked in the footer. There is another freelance project I'm working on right now, called GateKeeper, which will be shipped sometime within the end of this month (August 2025). It taught me how to interact with a client, and what it really means to implement real-world solutions, instead of just passion projects.

## Foreseeable Future

This journey has been nothing short of fantastic, and I'm looking forward to studying computer engineering at uni. I envision myself working in the field of computer science in the future, using my talents and drive to make positive contributions to humanity.
