## Experience

I have been on a study in London from the 27th of July to the 9th of August, and i'm going to tell you all about it. The experience was great, I matured as a person and i've met lots of interesting and stimulating people from all around the world.

## Lessons

We had 2 hours and 40 minutes of english lessons each day. I was in the highest class level, *C2.3*. Our assignments were not easy, but they taught me a lot. We held debates, talked about politics, discussed future predictions, wrote essays, and much more. Sometimes we had classes early in the morning, otherwise we had them in the late afternoon.

## People

The people have been fantastic. Only a few days have passed, so it's early to say for sure, but for now i'm keeping contact with many of them! Some are from Mexico, others from France, and one is from my home country, Italy. If it were not for my fellow students, I would have not enjoyed this vacation as much. It was so interesting to understand the differences in culture between Libya and Japan, and to see people from every continent come together to converse in english. The situation made it possible to accelerate how fast an acquaintance could become a friend, thus allowing access to many interesting stories and backgrounds. Everybody knew that most of these new friendships were ephemeral, so secrets flowed without shame or embarassment, with the confidence of who knows that their mate is going to be on the other side of the planet in a week. Speaking of mates, many of my friends found love, or at least someone to keep them warm in those nights. One thing is for sure: I've seen so many different ways of living life, that my own has evolved as a result. I took the best parts of each one's own, and integrated them into mine.

## Accomodation

The accomodation was nice. If you look it up on the internet, you'll see terrible reviews, with an average of 2.5 stars, but I beg to disagree. I mean, the shower's temperature could be graphed by a sinusoid, where you have celsius on the y axis and seconds on the x axis. At least it wasn't random. It was reliably ondulating between hot and cold. If you put the handle somewhere in the middle, you would have remission periods between the scalding hot and the freezing cold. I am amazed at the engineering that must have been behind such a faulty system, it really makes you wonder how a system can mess up this badly. To get back on topic, the best part of the accomodation were the people. I had fantastic roommates, we played cards together (and I destroyed them), and we also played videogames together (and they destroyed me). Most importantly, we talked a lot. There were evenings where we were too tired to move from the sofa to the bed to sleep, so we just chatted, laying there. It really felt like a mystical experience, being too tired to feel your body's position in space, but not having the heart to stop a conversation because it is too interesting.

## City

The city is simply **beautiful**. I love big cities, so I might be a little biased here. Come on, how can you not appreciate a view of the fantastic parliament, with the Big Ben a part of the skyline alongside modern skyscrapers? You turn your head, and you see cranes and construction sites, which to me show the continuous growth of a restless city. Then you have companies like DeepMind and Unilever, that provide for so many services and products both for common use and more widely for humanity, which have their headquarters in London. There is St. James' Park, too, where I lied on the grass with a friend to simply relax and admire the surrounding flora and fauna. I love the efficiency of the tube, and the size of the double decker buses, such effective transportation methods to easily navigate such a big city.

## Final Remarks

I would recommend anyone my age, especially before starting uni, to go on a study holiday. There are so many people to meet, so many places to visit, that one cannot simply lose the opportunity. I loved it, and i have grown as a person.
